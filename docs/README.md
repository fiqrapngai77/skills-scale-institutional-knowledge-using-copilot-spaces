# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation hub. This collection of process documents provides comprehensive guidance on how OctoAcme delivers cross-functional projects successfully—from initial concept through continuous improvement.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five core principles: customer-first prioritization, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Every project follows a structured lifecycle that begins with **initiation**, where teams validate business need, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight project charter. This foundation ensures that work is authorized with clear success metrics and measurable outcomes before significant resources are committed.

The **planning and execution** phases translate validated initiatives into actionable backlogs and daily delivery rhythms. During planning, teams break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies, define acceptance criteria, and establish a Definition of Done. Execution follows established workflows including daily standups, weekly syncs, and regular demos—all supported by project boards, pull request conventions, and comprehensive quality assurance practices. Key roles collaborate throughout: Project Managers coordinate delivery and manage risks, Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize work, Developers implement features, and QA validates quality. This clear ownership model, combined with structured communication cadences and escalation paths, ensures teams stay aligned and blockers are resolved quickly.

**Risk management, release processes, and continuous improvement** complete OctoAcme's project lifecycle. Teams maintain living risk registers that are reviewed weekly, follow standardized deployment checklists with rollback plans, and conduct retrospectives after each sprint, release, or milestone. Communication strategies include weekly status updates, monthly stakeholder briefings, and incident communication templates—all designed to maintain transparency and enable data-driven decisions. Release and deployment practices emphasize safety through staged rollouts, smoke testing, and clear incident response procedures.

This documentation framework supports onboarding, provides role-specific guidance for diverse personas (Developers, Product Managers, Project Managers), and serves as living institutional knowledge that teams can reference and evolve. Whether you're initiating a new project, planning your next sprint, managing risks, or facilitating a retrospective, these docs provide templates, checklists, and best practices to deliver value iteratively and reliably.
